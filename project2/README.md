# **Project 2**
Send a parsed file from one machine (client) to another machine (server) over a socket to do word count.
Then return results from server back to client.

Compile your code
```
mvn package
```

## **Executables**
If not already in project1 directory, cd project2

Start a peer

```
java -cp target/project2-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar Main
```

## **Notes**
Please ensure your inputted csv file is in the resources directory:

```
project1/src/main/resources/
```
In addition, a copy of the results on client-side can also be found in:

```
src/main/resources/results
```

Project1's design architecture is located next to this README.md as:
